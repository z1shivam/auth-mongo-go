# Go generated files (if you want to ignore them)
# These are often regenerated, so it's a matter of preference
# If you don't ignore them, they'll be tracked by Git
# *_easyjson.go # EasyJSON generated files (example)
# <your_generated_files>.go

# If you have specific files you want to ignore, add them here
# Example:
# my_secret_file.txt

# If you want to include a specific file within an ignored directory, use the "!" (negate) operator
# Example:
# vendor/
# !vendor/some_package/go.mod  # Include the go.mod for a specific vendored package
