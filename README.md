# learning golang backend

This is prob. my first golang project which I am making on my own in order to learn golang. This is a basic login-register app which I am making in order to learn some basic concepts of the backend in golang and the engineering side of the same.

What I learned?
1. Database - I used mongo db for the storing of data of users.
2. GoLang philosophy - I learn the benefit of using golang over others (typescript ;|), GoLang seems quite easy to vertically scale. You can just add more compute units and your app can now handle much more traffic. Whereas in other languages like Typescript, you have  to just rely on horizontal scaling. Docker, K8s and what not. The architecture in horizontal scaling is quite complicated. GoLang make you write applications simpler and have less headache maintaining that.
3. Interfaces and Context - These 2 concepts was something which I struggled to understand before. But as I made this app, I explored more on these concepts and now I can say, yes, I know something sensible about these. I am not saying I understand these fully now, but I now somewhat get it's use and reason for existance.
